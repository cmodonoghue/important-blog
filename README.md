Template for a blog site I created to practice responsive, mobile-first development, and using GatsbyJS with Netlify CMS for easy content management. Using GraphQL queries, markdown files generated by the CMS are sent to the React app. 

Built with:
* HTML/CSS/JS
* React
* SASS
* Gatsby
* GraphQL 
* NetlifyCMS.
